# Notification Relay
Allows you to send notifications from your web server or from other devices to all subscribed devices.

The app listens for messages from other apps that it will then relay to your devices. 

If you don't want a centralized notification relay, you can still use this logic into your own app for implementing Push notifications.

It uses Push API + Service Workers + Notifications API to deliver the notifications.
